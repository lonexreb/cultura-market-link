- **Timeline Visualization**: Waterfall view showing request timing

### Key Components

#### Stats Overview
- **Total Requests**: Count of all HTTP requests
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful requests
- **Average Response Time**: Mean response time across all requests
- **Requests/Second**: Current request rate
- **Data Transfer**: Total bytes sent and received
- **Tokens Used**: Total tokens consumed across AI providers

#### Timeline View
Professional waterfall visualization featuring:
- Time scale with precise markers
- Visual bars showing request duration
- Color-coded status indicators
- HTTP method and status code display
- Token usage for AI operations
- Hover tooltips with detailed information

#### Real-time Monitoring
- **Live Updates**: Server-Sent Events for real-time data
- **Play/Pause Controls**: Start/stop monitoring
- **Restart Functionality**: Clear all operations and start fresh
- **Filtering**: Search and filter by operation type, status, etc.

### Usage

1. **Navigate to Network Tab**: Click the Network tab in the main interface
2. **Start Monitoring**: Ensure monitoring is active (play button)
3. **Run Workflow**: Execute any workflow using Run or Deploy
4. **View Results**: Watch real-time HTTP requests in the timeline
5. **Analyze Performance**: Review metrics and analytics

## üîÑ Workflow Execution Integration

### Run Button Enhancement
The "Run" button now uses real backend execution instead of simulation:

**Before**: Frontend simulation with mock data
**After**: Real backend API calls with HTTP tracking

### Execution Flow
1. **Frontend**: Converts React Flow nodes/edges to workflow definition
2. **Backend**: Validates and executes workflow using topological sort
3. **HTTP Tracking**: Monitors all outgoing API requests during execution
4. **Network Monitoring**: Displays real-time request data in networking tab
5. **Results**: Returns actual AI responses and execution metrics

### Benefits
